<p>Cryptids of Texas:</p>

<button href="#" id="display-dd">SHOW US THE CRYPTIDS!</button>

    <dt>The Wampus Cat</dt>
    <dd class="invisible"> The Wampus Cat originally began as a tribal legend among Native American hunters in Tennessee.
        Allegedly, a woman of the tribe who spied on the hunters while wearing a cougar skin was transformed
        into a half woman/half cougar by one of the tribal elders as a punishment. Other legends abound.
        Making its way into Texas, the Wampus Cat has been said to be a type big cat much like a cougar,
        just larger, more fearsome, and possibly with various types of mystical powers. Cryptid hunters
        and folklorists also report the Wampus Cat as a giant bobcat with an uncanny ability to swim
        and to disappear and reappear at will.</dd>

    <dt>Bigfoot</dt>
    <dd class="invisible"> Bigfoot, Sasquatch, the Squatch Himself, whatever you want to call him,
        Texas is not devoid of its own rumors, suspicions, and sightings
        of one of the most famous cryptids of all time.
        Texas has many sightings and reports of Bigfoot. Some have been “caught” on camera,
        but none have been confirmed by science. While reports have been made in every
        geographical region in the state, the highest concentration has come from
        East and Southeast Texas, particularly the Piney Woods region. If you live in these
        regions, stay on the lookout. You could very well receive a visit from this famous beast.</dd>

    <dt>Hogzilla</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Hogzilla is otherwise a name given to the rare development of extremely large wild/feral hogs.
        Texas, with its exploding hog population, has encountered wide-ranging reports of giant hogs
        roaming the countryside. Cryptid hunters and cryptozoologists have been staking claims that there
        are hogs as big as 2000-3000 pounds out there in the wild based upon photos captured on game cameras.
        Many of these photos have proven to be doctored photos and hoaxes. In Texas, the biggest
        hogs on record have weighed around 800 pounds. While anyone will tell you an 800-pound hog
        is gigantic, cryptid enthusiasts believe bigger hogs may be out there. Keep your eyes
        peeled, you may spot the official Hogzilla.</dd>
